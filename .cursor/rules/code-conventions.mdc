PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS A MONOREPO SO TREAT IT AS SUCH

# Backend + frontend
Whenever you are writing code, always document functions using common convention for that language (usually typescript/jsdoc). Document the purpose of the function, the parameters it takes, and the return value. Also make sure to comment any non-obvious code.

DO NOT ADD UNNECESSARY COMMENTS, I AM AN EXPERT.

# Frontend
USE REACT BEST PRACTICES!!! If you think you should create a new component, make sure to use the best practices for that component.
Try to keep code modular and reusable. Use hooks, context, and other features of react to make code more maintainable, BUt don't overuse them.
For styling, please use @global.css and either add or use the colors already present there
